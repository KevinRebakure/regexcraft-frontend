## Look & Aesthetic

The design should feel modern, sleek, and professional while celebrating African creativity. It should evoke a sense of vibrancy but remain clean and easy to navigate. Consider these design elements:

- **Minimalistic layout**: Clear sections with lots of white space, making the text and visuals stand out.
- **Rounded buttons**: To give it a more modern feel and improve user experience.

- **High-quality visuals**: Featuring African filmmakers on location, behind the scenes, and snippets from short films.

## Features to Include

- **Film Library**: A well-organized collection of short films, categorized by genre, theme, or region. Include filtering options (e.g., most recent, top-rated, etc.).
